[![Build](https://travis-ci.org/spikymonkey/advent-of-code-2015.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/spikymonkey/advent-of-code-2015)

Solutions to [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) in Clojure.
Just for fun, and to try to keep my hand in.

Suggestions on idiomatic refactorings very welcome!

Many thanks to the Advent of Code team for creating a fun Christmas
Challenge.
